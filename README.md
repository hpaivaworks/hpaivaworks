Hi, my name is Héricles Paiva and I'm graphic designer and (former) front-end developer.

I’m currently learning React and advanced JavaScript

I’m looking to collaborate on projects who need a front-end developer to increase my experience and my Portfolio.

You can reach me on Behance or Instagram.
